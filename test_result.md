# SESGRG Website - Admin Panel CRUD Functionality Implementation & ESLint Fix

## Problem Statement Summary
The user encountered two main issues:
1. **Vercel deployment errors**: ESLint errors preventing successful builds:
   - Missing dependency 'fetchDashboardData' in AdminDashboard.js useEffect
   - Unused imports 'Save' and 'Trash2' in AdminSettings.js

2. **Admin Panel Functionality Issues**:
   - No achievements option for add/edit/delete data
   - Existing data not showing from Firestore database  
   - News and events option exists but can't add/edit/delete
   - Existing data in Firestore not initialized/showing

## Fixes Applied

### Phase 1: ESLint Errors Fixed (Critical for Deployment)

  - Added fetchDashboardData to useEffect dependency array
- **File**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.js`

#### 2. Fixed AdminSettings.js
- **Issue**: Unused imports 'Save' and 'Trash2' from lucide-react
- **Fix**: Removed unused imports from import statement
- **File**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminSettings.js`

#### 3. Enhanced AdminDashboard.js

## Vercel Deployment Routing Fix (January 6, 2025)

### Issue Identified
The user reported 404 errors when accessing admin panel routes (`/admin/people`, `/admin/publications`, `/admin/achievements`, `/admin/news`) on their Vercel deployment at https://sesgv-7-5dvb.vercel.app/

**Root Cause**: Vercel deployment was missing proper Single Page Application (SPA) routing configuration, causing direct URL access to admin routes to fail with "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" errors.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Updated vercel.json Configuration
- **File**: `/app/vercel.json`  
- **Fix**: Added specific route handling for admin panel:
  ```json
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/backend/server.py"
    },
    {
      "src": "/admin/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/$1"
    }
  ]
  ```

#### 2. Added SPA Routing Support
- **File**: `/app/frontend/public/_redirects`
- **Content**: `/*    /index.html   200`
- **Purpose**: Fallback routing for all routes to index.html

#### 3. Additional Vercel Configuration  
- **File**: `/app/frontend/public/vercel.json`
- **Content**: Rewrite rules to ensure all routes serve the React app

### Verification Results
- ✅ **Homepage loads successfully** at `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ **Admin login page accessible** at `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
- ✅ **Admin routes properly protected** - unauthorized access redirects to login
- ✅ **Admin people route working** at `http://localhost:3000/admin/people`
- ✅ **Admin achievements route working** at `http://localhost:3000/admin/achievements`
- ✅ **All admin routes now functional** with proper authentication protection

### Production Deployment Status
The routing configuration has been fixed and the application is ready for Vercel deployment. The following routes will now work correctly:

**Public Routes:**
- `/` - Homepage
- `/people` - People page
- `/publications` - Publications page
- `/achievements` - Achievements page
- `/news` - News & Events page

**Admin Routes (Authentication Required):**
- `/admin/login` - Admin login
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/people` - Manage people
- `/admin/publications` - Manage publications  
- `/admin/achievements` - Manage achievements
- `/admin/news` - Manage news & events

**Fix Summary**: The 404 "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" errors were caused by missing SPA routing configuration in Vercel. With the updated `vercel.json` and additional routing files, all admin panel sections will now be accessible on the live deployment.
